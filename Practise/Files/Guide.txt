it's time to strive!!!!  read this at each morning and evening.

defects of playing pc games too much.
1.have less time in studying Eng and Tech
2.Have less time to spend with wife and child
3.Have less time to do excercise, do harm to my health.
4.make me less spiritual in my work and life, since pc games always make me stay late.
