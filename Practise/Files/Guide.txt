英语听写:

提高听力，绝对没有捷径。花胡桃作为一枚翻译，在听力上下过大把功夫。以我的亲身经历而言，最有效的方法就是「听抄」，但这也是最痛苦的办法。因为需要花上大量的时间，而且还得不断重复训练。


所谓「听抄」，其实就是给听力训练增加了一个抄写的步骤 —— 把自己听到的东西，逐字逐句地写下来。具体步骤如下：

—— 泛听：整篇泛听，理解全文大意；

—— 精听：每听一至两句话暂停，将听到的内容逐字逐句抄写下来；

—— 重听：音频重放，综合语境查漏补缺（此步骤可重复多遍）；

—— 查阅：对于听不出来的部分，试着“大胆假设，小心求证”，利用各种渠道进行查询，再放回原文进行验证，尽量补充出更多的内容；

—— 对照：将自己的听抄与原文进行对比，看哪些地方没有听出来，并分析原因。例如，是否因为单词不认识？是否因为自己本身发音不标准，导致正确发音反而听不出来？还是讲话人有什么口音？…… 然后，有针对性地各个击破。


大家如果能按照这个方法听上三个月，一定会体验量变到质变的神奇过程。可能你要想，「什么？这么久？」拜托，你英语不好的时间都十几二十年了，还在乎花上这三个月吗？


　听力立体训练法的周期一般是三个月时间。在这三个月的时间中，横向的听抄和速读练习是应该贯穿始终坚持去做的，而纵向的三个层次可以分阶段来做。第一个月的时间应该以单词突破为主，
这里需要强调的一点是雅思的单词不仅要做到会听，还一定要做到会拼写，所以一定要保证三遍以上的循环才行。第二个月的时间应该以场景和题型的突破为主，各个击破并辅之以单词的复习。
而最后一个月要进入综合训练的环节，每周完整地做两到三套真题，并且根据做题的情况对单词，场景和题型进行总结回顾式的复习，对于薄弱环节重点突破。 


在选择之前其实看了很多关于这个方法的褒贬，最后看到无老师那句这是听力提高的唯一且必须的途径，于是下定决心坚持了一个月，今天是第28天，终于看到显著的效果了，听力从之前的几乎错70%到现在的只错一两道题。好吧，我承认我很开心。每个lecture几乎都能听懂。
只想鼓励大家继续坚持下去，一定会有结果了。想想自己之前看不到这个方法的效果的时候的难受，我能理解大家的心情，但是相信我，坚持下去，想想自己看美剧都不用字幕会是怎么个帅！！！
加油啊，祝大家都考个好成绩。o(∩_∩)o

所以要先有200小时的有效输入并且找熟悉的材料，但这件事本身比听写简单一点。如果没有几百小时有效输入的基础，听写的是不熟悉的材料，句子又臭又长，
您能坚持听写三个月每天3个小时，我也敬您一条汉子。

 建议：1000小时听写！材料无需多（控制好生词量）！最好同时进行“听读”和复述。对于过了语言最佳学习期的我们，你要坚信，学语言一定是痛苦的
 。而最笨的方法往往是最好的方法（想想达芬奇的学画经历） 最后，允许我再次引用新东方某位老师的至理名言：“听写是提高听力的唯一手段”。
  “你们根本不知道这句话有多经典。”



  ****************************5 ways to improve listening English

  A 5-Step Method to Improve Your Listening Skills

Step 1: Listen to the Audio – No Reading!

The first step in this method is to simply listen to the audio alone. Don’t read the text in advance and don’t follow along with it as you listen. The point here is to focus solely on your aural skills and see how much you can understand without any visual aid.

Of course, unless you’re already at a very high level, this can be very difficult. Rather than trying to understand every single word, it’s better to focus on trying to understand the ‘gist’ of what’s being said.

See if you can pick out some key words or phrases that might give you an idea of what’s being said and note them down. Find anything at all that you can cling on to and you’ll be able to use this as starting point to learn more from the context.

Step 2: Repeat!

It’s not time to look at the text just yet. Many learners make the mistake of turning to the text too quickly. However, the point here is to practice your listening skills so just stay focused on listening for the time being.

On the first listen, you’ll probably have identified one or two key words or ideas. As you repeat the audio, listen carefully and see if you can pick out and words or phrases you may have missed the first time. By now you may already have some idea what this piece of audio is about, so use the context to your advantage. If you can’t figure out exactly what’s going on, don’t worry. Just note down any keywords you do understand or words that seem important.

At this stage, I’d suggest listening at least three more times. With each listen, you can add a little more to your comprehension. Your goal should be to try and use all of your current knowledge in the language to understand as much as possible from the audio before you read the text. When you feel you’ve reached a point where there’s nothing more you can take from the recording, it’s time to move onto the next step.

Step 3: Get Reading

Now it’s time to look at the text. Read through it and check how much you understood from your listening. Did you get the ‘gist’ of it?

As you read through the text, identify any new words you come across. See if you can guess the meaning of the words from their context; otherwise, look them up in a dictionary. If there are any new words that you think will be particularly useful for you in conversation, write them down and add them to your list of new vocabulary to learn.

As well as new words you haven’t seen before, you’ll also likely find words in the text that you already know but didn’t understand! Some words can sound quite different when spoken together and at native level speed. Pay careful attention to these words and be sure to listen out for them when you repeat the audio.

Step 4: Listen With the Text

Once you’ve read through the text a few times and looked up any words you didn’t understand, you should be confident about its meaning. Next, I suggest listening again a couple of more times while you read along with the text.

This is the one time during the process that you’re using aural and visual stimuli together, so take advantage of it. Try to connect the written words to the sounds and pay special attention to phrases or groups of words and how they’re pronounced.

If there were a lot of new words in the text you’re working on, trying breaking the audio down into smaller chunks as you continue to repeat it. Rather than repeating the whole recording at once, you can work through paragraph by paragraph if you prefer.

I tend to repeat this step at least twice to help build connections between the written and spoken words.

Step 5: Listen Again Without the Text

Finally, go back and listen again a few more times without the text. By this point, you should be able to understand almost everything quite well even without the visual aid of the text.

Over the next few days, it’s good to listen back to the clip again whenever you have a chance. Download the recording to your phone so you can have a quick listen any time you get a few free minutes. With each extra repetition your comfort level will grow. Because you’re now able to understand the words and phrases you studied without any visual aid, you’ll also find it easier to recognise this vocabulary when it comes up conversations or in other recordings you listen to.

In Conclusion: There’s no Quick Fix for Listening Skills

Whether you’re learning a language or any other skill, there’s no magic solution.

Improving your listening skills takes time and a lot of focused listening but if you work at it in the right way you can actually make significant improvements faster than you might think.
