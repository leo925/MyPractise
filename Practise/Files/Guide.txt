 六月24日决定一个新任务： 接下来的一周养成一个新的习惯： 每时每刻，充分利用第一分钟，每一个学习的机会， 认真学习， 习惯很重要， 不要懒惰（这是我30年来的一个缺点)
 不要玩游戏了，它只能伤身，伤神，影响健康，工作，学习，多想想如果成为技术牛人的成就感。


it's time to strive!!!!  read this at each morning and evening.

defects of playing pc games too much.
1.have less time in studying Eng and Tech
2.Have less time to spend with family
3.Have less time to do excercise, do harm to my health.
4.make me less spiritual in my work and life, since pc games always make me stay up late.

give up computer games, think of how wonderful it would be if I am proficient in English and Programming.
and I have to be strong, think of those stupid guys xx , if I want to get rid of them , I have to be skillful at tech.
no compouter games in the next months, I have to be intereted and focused on study.
if I want to totally focus on English and Tech study , I have to give up pc games.    
                  
instructions: at office, except I have to speak to team, I only think in english, speak Eng with myself, so there's no chinese in my mind,    
so, 3 hours for english use, and 2 hours for learning pluralsight with english , I could have 5 hours at least in english use, that sounds perfect!!!
5 *25    125 hours a month in english use, 

english use is very important, today , I learned queue number, house fund, traffic restriciton based on the last digit of license plate numbers.
