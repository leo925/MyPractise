﻿the image will shink because the column it is inside is shrininking 
and the text is rearranging and re-laying itself on the screen, because it doesn't have as much horizontal width as it did before 

and let me stretch the broser  back  out, and jsut so you can see if i inspct elemtn on span 1, you can see the width here is 6 percent and change 
this is the classic design trade-off, do u want the content to be reaed, as the brwose resizes, and keep thing on the scerren, 
in the case, you want to stick with a fixed grid, 

resonsive design is a movement that is pick up steam over the past years, sinc more and more phone ont he  the internet re using  tablets, phone, to browse the web 

and the peope are using all sorts of screen sizes, we want to create an optum viewing  exp the for each of them 
optim meaning we to keep the content eashy to read, 
we want to keep the site usrable by having na links availbe, we don;t want to forece a mobile user 
to soom in , zoom out , scroll and pan to get around 
and the same tiem, the user with large sceen we  want the web site to look good for them to  

and the babluser vistes the site, we want it to look good in   landscape-mode
and when they rotate the tablet  90 degree   to look at it in protrait mode, we want it to look good too 
on css f tha enables this responsive design is the  media query feature, the query looks like code you see on the scerrn, 
that sth oyu find in responsive bt style sheet, 
the will aply style to a docu,net only  when the scren has a width between 768  and 979 px
that 's the range of many tablets in portrait mode, 
inside that media query , insdie of the curly braces, u can writhe as many styles as you want ,these tylses hide things, show things, make things
smaller than usual, or larger than usual, 
you can over snything from the default fontsize to container size, to wolumn width, and there are many more queries you can use other than just min ans max width
but those are 2 queries almost always  use in the responsive design,  
bt take care of those  media query        for you ,    in fact they have already defined 5 diferen categroies of  screnn width, 
every thing from the phone-sized screen that is 480 px below,  
to a large display that wil be anyghing that have more than 1200 px horitally 

width dferen size o

fo in we swa the contian had the size of  940 px, if we use bt resonsive  style sheet , bt would change from 940 to 1170px if the web page is showing on a larger display

the col width in this table is showing the width of  span1 coulun of course you double that for  span 2 column and so on  

the gutter width is the space between columns


i notice the colunm widths on screens with less the 767 px become fluid , that they are  percentagebased, 
 ans as we  saw  they can shripkk and grow ,
  but i should also point out all the coluns on this scren size  lose thier flow and stack up on each other , they are gotin to  lay out vertically on the page

  back in our sample i just want to refresh your  memory how this currently  behave in diddferenct befoere we add in any respnvisev elements
  we have on the top , we have fluid grid on the bottom, and if i shink the browse down to about the width of a smart phone's screen
  ou can see that the fix grid stays in the fixed 940 px contianer, a lot of content is now off to the right that forces the user to scroll, pan or zoom

  and the flu has it's own sets of proble, yes it keeps any tihg in the screen, beut it can't make colunn, like those span1 columns
   they are so smaller liek ths psan they are not usable any more, 

   ubin that case, there 's a class called tabbable you can use, jsut very similar to nave tabs
   but also a little diffrent, 
   so if i format this code and alos fix it up so we dont ahve rows inside of our spans

    then what wie wil see is we have a div with a class of tabbable, we have an unorder list  
	that will be our nav tab, it's goint to be 2 tabs inside of here, tab1, 2, 
	those are both using anhor tag inside list items as   you would expect,

﻿

let's build a drop down menu, a simple dropdown menu with btstrap,  what i want is a link on the screen, 
and when the user licks on the link , i don't want to nav to somewhere , perform some acton, 
i jsut want i tto drop down a list of options that a yser can select 
ot nav to somewhere or perform some aciton, 
this dp compen requerist some interactivity, it needs response to a click event, 
and b of that, there's 3 requriements in this page, 
first of all , we do have to include the basic twitter bt stle sheet , we always need that, 
but now, we also need to include the jquery library, and the bt js librabry which has a depency on jqueyr, 
i am going to put these 2 scripts at the top of the page, but you can aslo include them at the bottom of the page if you want, 
the way you may build a drop down menu is to first have a div, it's going to encapulate every thing, it's going to 
have a class 'dropdown', this is my anchor tag, that's the text i want to display, i want the user to click on this to open a , 
and to do that, i jsut need to add a class , i am going to call it the drop down toggle, 
this is what toggles the mune open aand closed, 
and i am goin to add data-toggle attri, equals drop down, 
think of that essentailly as a flag, that  wuld be bt js is goint to look for, and 
and it can hook into to click event on the anchor tag, and make sth apeear or disappear, 

and now i just need to menu, menu is most css framwork are  modoled using an ordered list, 
because each menu item is just a list item, and once w ehav ea colleciton of lis titem, we can use css to make them appear vetial 
horital , or disappear all together, i wil give the unorder list the calss of 'dropdwon menu', 
so this represents the menu i want to drop down, and then i 'll build simple items with anchor tags inside, 
no special styles required here, i jus tneed the text and the link i need, we ill have pluralishit link, and may be 
we wil lmake amazon link, amaxon.com, and that's all i need, that's the simplest drop down , possible
now i lick this, you get a drop down list,  
and this drop list works similar to maony of the componets in bs,  there's a sort of expected html structure you are toing to have, 
tytpecall, a div encapsulat the entire componet, and there are some sub-peice in side 
those pieces are identified by specific classes, what should appear, what should drop down,  shold de on the left hand side or the ri

we'll this agaio and again , you can actualy use this drop down list in diffrent places, 
not just alone in a page like this, but also inside of a buttion , inside of a navigation bar, 

now, one thing that is a litter unfor about this drop down list menu is it kind of seanks up on the user, 
there's no indicaiton that when i lick here , sth is goin to appear,  it's be nicer if i put a indicator here 
to hint the user that is sth  behind this link , and an easy way to do that, is just   add a span with lcass of caret, 
this deesn't requre any content inside this span, jst addong the markup and refreshing, 
i get a little drop down here,  and the way this works is sort of smart, 
this isn't a character, this isn't an icon, it's in the  twitter icons
i fyou look at the bootstrap css file for caret,  you iwll the caret is sth has no height , no width, 
butn and no content, but it doesn't ahve a border, and the border is cleverly defined so that we get thsi downward pointing bracket, 
it's esscential what is left behind after you overlay a right and left transparent border
this is one of the modern tricks you will see css frameworks uses
and in fact u'll find entire sites devoted to avoinding imgs and build shapes with css borders, 
because once you can bild a triangle like this, you can conbine triangles to biuld almost every thin,s 
and can combin trigle with css3 rounded  corners to make some really interesting effects, 
but i did add some atr to the markup to improve the accessibility , namely i andd the role = menu to 
identifty  the content here soth that  offer choices and aria labeby attr to associtate 
i also se tthe tab index to negative value for the menu item in the  drop down metn, this prvents the tab key from naving to this hy
instaead the tab key hav thought the top level links in the page
and you can use the arrow key if you want to nav the menu iwth key borad, 
so tab ,,,  tab, down arre, p a, and i can hit enter to seelct that item
with attrs like role are very improtn i fyou want to build an acdible  applicaton that woark nicely with screen readers, 
the dividers are simply a list item with class of divider, and you put that in the menu, 
and now you ahve to opertunity to gropu commands, or separte commands that are a  litte special, separte them form the rest of the items
and ifn you have sub menu, and the sub menu wiil open iwht a lick or a hover, 
and the markup a submenu is siply an unorderlist that is nested inside of  a parent list item, and it has a class drop down menu, 
the parent item also needs to have a calss 'dropdown-submenu, and now we have see all the basics of menu in bt, 
so du this model we 'll se menus again and again as we place menu in nav bar , split buttions or other places, 
--------------
now let's look at buttion with menues, i am goint start off by reminding you about the button menu class
we've see before ,but i am showing it agion,  for 2 reasons, \
1 resiona is that addidng a menu to a button requirest the butotn gruop , but also i want to show you soem adddional 
variations on button group, a button group allows us to work in a inline set of buttions , 
the gron on the top in the browser windw is not in a button group  
that's wyh y the spcaing is little bit  differtn  than the buttions below, which are in a btn group, 
so i should palce these buttions in a buton group, but just to show you sth new, there's also a buttion gropu  vertical 
that's what the vertical group looks like, and you can see the shading is apply appropriately to the left of all butions, 
and now you see how it lines up with other but group, 
and if i want to have 2 grops assocted a little closer, i can put them both inside of a container, a div that has 
a btn tool bar class  , you can watch as i  refresh   and the spacing bewettn these, some of it disappears, 

that gives the toobar   effect with  segmented sets of different commands you can exeute by click on the butotn 
another p of butotn toolbar is  build bution you can create druop down menu iwth the butotn 
this is n't very much diff than we saw previousely , what we have is a btn toolbar, and inside of that is a btn group,  
therew'an anchor tag thati is a dropdown  toggle , but it's also now a buttion has a caret in it , 
and then an order list is the drop down menu, 
we can use any of the  classes we looked at in the last modul, for instance, i can make this a primary butiton, 
and also, respect the sizing calssses we saw in the previous module, so i can make this somewaht larger butiton, 
the drop down menu that appears , by the way, can have everthing we saw erlier, s oyou can add the divier, you can have sub menu
sth the i didn't mention before is that we can have menu drop up instead of dorp down, 
and i can do that by adding the droppu class to the btngropu , ,and refresh you can see the caret is now pointing upward, , 
when i lick is drop -up the menu insead of drop down,  we can also build button iwth 2 actions, 
there can be a primary action when the user clicks the buttion, and we can also optn eht drop down listh when the user click the caret, 

in the ui world, this type of buttion is known as split butiton, this not a split butiton ytes, but it's easy to convert it to split button
  to mke  a split butito, we actuall need 2 butitons, and i am goin to take this anchor tag, and copty , i t, 
  and this would be a primary button, what i need is give that butiton the calss, it' s no longer going to be a drop-down toggle
  and inseead, it's jsut  going to be the butn , and we ucan give it the larger size, 
  it doesn't need  data toggle, it not need the href, be presumarly when user click , they are goin to hav to swhere, 
  o rthe cy hook in to the click event of js script,  when they lick this part of the butiton, perform some aciton on the page,  

  and this but doesn't need to care , so  i am goona remvoe  the caret, and format the code a little bit, \
  and now ti spart is the caret,that 's all we  need, we don't need to text indise here, sand just save the page and refresh, 
  and one more thingk is to make this butito a little larger,  everytig here is appearing properly ,wand 
  and now i am goint to clin on this part of button,  we can nav to swhere, if i just lick on the caret, i get the drop down menu, 
  so that's the split butiton,   and if we were to  make that bution the parimary bution  and instead of the other one
  by adding btn pr to both anchor tags,  then the styling isappropriately applied, so and thee's a slight subtl border there between
   the caret and the regu butns

   the bs nav bar is a componet designed for you to build the  primary navgational area of you site, 
   like everth ing else rlated, it does revolve aorund  an unorderlist of menu items
   but there is a little more html structur, ininvolded, and there is a few new  tricks you can play with 
   here is a page with technical article inside, most of the ocntent is in grids, so there's a span 10 colomn here on the left 
   that contains text content, contains some imae,some  code listing 
   andthere's a span2 column on the right with nav list, 
   we just looled at the nav list, we are using a sort of secondary  nav list area here, 
   and the span 10 span 2 colunmn , we taed about these when  we  talkded about layout with bs in the bs layout module, 
   but here at the top , these are our primary nav links ,  only it doesn't look very nice, 
    let's trun this into a  nav bar,  the first thing i would do is add nav to my unordered list, 
	 of yoi have seen the lcass before, it's invoved in most of the nav menu item conponents, 
	 it simply remvoe the bullets and add a slight hover effect, and now i can put all of this inside of a nav bar, 
	 that  's simly a contianing div  or nave element, what a nav bar wild do is lay these thing horitall, 
	 and to privide a bit of separation between the nav bar and the rest of the contetn, and make it  stand out a little bit, 
	 i can have an inner div that wraps my unorder list, it's goin to be given the class navbar-inner, 
	save and refresh, and now i have a border and  in   offset from the content a lit, 
	that looks a lot nicer, it looks mare nav al , and quite often when you build nav bar like this, 
	you also want some text inside of the nav bar that represents you site name, your product name, you brand name, 
	contains a link to your homepage and the main areaof the siteyou can do that, 
	you can do that, just by adding an anchor class, this is going to be 'the sample site', this anchor tag has the class brand, 
	and so is freature that a little more prominently, but still fits here inside of the nav bar , it's a linck i can lick on to go wherever i want to go , 
	and this is a bais styling of nav bar, here is some class es ou can add to make it appear differently, 
	fist of all , on the nav bar itsel, i could say this is a mav static top , 
	but , nav bar static top does remove some of the margin that's between the nav bar and the rest of your content, 
	but in addiotn to static posiotn, which when i scroll down the page, sth that is statically psiitoned scoll off the top of the page, 
	if i want to key that nav alwasy on the top , and i can use fixed positoning, 
	i can say nav bar fixed top , therew's alos nav bar fixed botot, i fyo want to keep sth on the bootom of the screen,  
	and frefresh ,now i can scroll, andnthe nav boar stays there, but now it is a fixed element that's not in the 
	normal flow, my content  lifts up , and the nav is unforly hidding some of my ocntent, 
	so whenever you use th fixed posiitoning, at list with tha nav bar , you need to add some margin to the body, 
	about 40 px will do , so there's sth you will do in the stylesheet, and by haivng 40px margin, 

	no all of my contetn is push underneath the nav bar, yoiu can also make th stand ot a little bit, 
	goint og remove navbar fix, because i am not a big fan of fixed nav bar, and i am ogint to add nav bar inverse, 
	i could have inserse nav bar if i watned, wat inverse dones is to invert the color, 
	now the nav bar stands out a little bit form the rest of the ocntent that's on the page, 
	and like other menus we 've seen, in bs,  you can add sth that drop down, so i am gont to paste some a ocde that looks familiar

	it's alist item iwth class drop down, inside of the link i can click on the dropdown the menu
	and here is menu that will appear when click the link, 
	all things that we 'ave seen before this modeule, and if i refresh all will havior hopefully, just like you expecte,d 
	you can also put forms inside of your nav bar, so quite common htat sone want to see a   search form in your nav bar, 
	so i wil have a form with input type eques search, aside that is a big serach buttion, 
	place that inside of the nav bar, the spacing is little bit  strang, 
	but we can fix that up with some   some adiitonal classes , there are special classes for forms inside of the nav bar, 
	there's a nav-bar -form ,navbar-swerch, so this i s a search form i 'll say  navbar-search, 
	 i am also gion to say pull -right, we havesee the before, it's goin to push all of thsi to the right side to the screen
	 and input-addpend allows the search button to append itself to the text input box, 
	 looking a little bit better now, but one thing keep in mind when you buiding a nav bar, 
	 how is it going to work on a mibole screen, in anohter word,
	  this looks great  stretching out on a big destop display in a  plurasight vedio,  
	  but what will happen when it's on a   on b tablet or smart phone
	  now it starts to scrnch up and it takes a lot of vertical space spcace, 
	  and that might not look very good in a smart phone, the first ithi is to add in bs respovive tyel sheet 
	  we talkd about responve design previsously when we looked at this  in the layout model, 

	  bt res culd also impact how your nav bar works , if you put  the right  compnaent inside, 
	  but the ifrst thing you have t decid  is when the screen is so small, what do i really need to dispay at this point, and 
	  what do i hid,  what i wouldwant to dislay this this point on the screen of  the size is just the brand link, so the sample .
	  and perhpahs hide everything else  or cloaspe it down so you user can get to the other artile, blogs, and about, 
	  but i don't want to  take up any vertical space, 
	  wel to do that, I ll come back to html, and these area i want to hid i am going to warp them all inside of a div that 
	  has   classes of nave clopplase, collapse, htat' wrap my menu items, that 's goin to warp search form, 
	  an di put a closing div tag dow here at the bottom, a contorl N,d to formmat things up , 
	  and if i just that sgtep and save, and refresh, and now on the smart phone, these tings simply collapse, 
	  also on small  tablet;  so collpase or go go away completely
	  what if i want user to be able to get into those ting; a typical bs approach is to add a little it of ui here 
	  out isde of the collpasible eleemtn, sth that a use can lick on or expand on ?
	  it dones' have nay text in side, simply using thre icions stacked on top of each other 
	  whchil you will see what  effect  that procude in a second, if a user click on this , 
	  the data togel and targ attr are set up, let the bs konw what need to go is go to find out the nav copplased , 
	  and either expand it or copplased it when the user click on this link
	  so no js required,at leat i didn't write any js,   but in order ofr  this to work , agian
youi need bs  responvie and bs jasvascip fiel which requers jquery , so save this page one more ting, 

and these are what the three bars icon will come out to look like , i can lick on that , 
it expand down the menu , i can get to it ,i can  caplas it when my screen is mostly contetn, and on a 
 , full dispay,the little piece of ui will go away , and i can  work iwth  the link directly , 
so that'a little bit  of responsive design  you can add to your navigation bar,  
and somewhat related to the otpic of nav bar are bread crumbs , 
so what can i put on the page so the user know  wehre thay are in the hiarchy o fmy site, 
 bs dones have a bread crumb class that you can apply ,  if i come into  , lte's say the  container,
  and before the article title, i wil paste in another unorder list,this has a class of breadcrumb, 
and inside of htee, it's just bacially the hiearchy the user folloed to get to this particular url
and inside of articles , added some spans with the class of  divider, and the  baisic ui you will get will look like this
and just one more top realted to naviation, if this is the first page of article, 
i may want to have a page contorn on the top of the scrren,or on  the bottom of the scrren, or the top and the bottom
and bs also privides panitation class and some pager  controls, let's paste in a bit of html code, 
now i'll put it at the top of the screen, that contains some page numbers or links of page nubmers, 
agian , it's all centered around an unorderlist of links, this tiem the list is inside of a div with clas spaniation, 
all you need ofr a pager to diaplsy , i also add panation-center to move it to the  cernt of the container , 
ou can do paniaiton right to righ-align it, or leass off that class off  entiery to left align it
and thee's diferent pagination size you can  leave off pagen- large to get the default size, but here's large, samll, mini, 
so paniation-mini, items inside can be marded as diable, in that  case i problay want to render it with  the span 
so it dones look clickable and alos  proly then  not have the h ref on the   span tag, 
many of them revolve around the use of lists, lists of links

here are some of other componetns in bs you may find intereting, not all of them are interactive, but they do requrei 
some html structure,v e.g, the hero uni , the hero unit is sth you might have as a teaser at the home page of your sight
it consitst of a big billboard text with sub title  underneath, and yo can include a large buttion to encourage the visitor to lick that and try sth out, 
there rere unit it selft  you   construct at it just using a div iwth the class of hero-unit, 
insde you cna have a header tag for the big text  and parahgraph for the bustitle, the defaut fontsize for the reguar text 
inside a hero unit is  18px, everythins larger in the hero unit, as yo ucan see also , it   also a subtly diferrent bg color, 
alos in the sidebar of the page,you can see the labels and badges of bs,  
labels are text inside of a  slightly rounded box, there's dee color you can aply for defat, suce, wanring , info and inverse lable, 

and if I flip over inott he edtior and go to the bootom of the page, you can see  how to construct lable, 
so the default label is just a span iwth class of label, you can also ahve label-warning, warign, import , info  , inverse,
inverse of course being the opposite of the  default color scheme, 

so what's the best way to get started  writing a html5  page , ro , you can just code by hand, 
and the syntax is actually pretty simple, but it might do you well to get acquainted with htoml boilerplate,  
the idea here is that there is structure, evelemt and  valued that are needed for  just about  every html5 page
and the boilerplate makes it super simple to get started on the page, 
so let's take a look at h5 boilerplater .com, so here we are on the site,  and as you can tell i'ts  billed sa the 
web's most populate front-end tmeplate, so once yo get here, you can down load the latest biuld, or get a custom build
and we;ll look at both of thoes; so as we i scool down a little bit, you can see what's included in the boilerplate, 
so you can see it comes with analytics and icons, and  packages with  juqeyr and modernizr
but the most importat part is in fact that normalize css, what n css does is that it takes maony of styles ralated in 
inconsistences amoung brwoers and resert them to ocmmon values or normalize them , 
to give an explae of why this is mportant, let's say you're relatively positioning a eleemnt inside   the body of a pag,e 
every browser would have the same default settings applied to the body element after apllying the normalize css, 
this ensure that your elemnet will show up at the same spot on the page no matter what brower you are using at the time 
and this is a huge help since you  then know every thing would be consistent among dfrr brwoers, 
and as i scroll down , you the idea of some big names that are using the html5boilerplate, 
let's look at the package to see what comes when you download the defulat version of html 5 boilerplate, 
when you open up the accomapnying zip file, you see a series of fiels and folders, 
so like i said before, one of the the fist things yo uget is normalize css, 
thjers are the rules applied to create consistence among differ browsers for all of the basic elemnt on the page, 
so to take it just a step further, main css applies some basic stying ot the page, 
and as it says here, is have an opinionated default
and all of this is set to giv eyou a solid baseline for you to begin styling your doc 
the doc a number of deff markdown doc you can read and hlep you learn how to use the boilerplate  better
and then some imgs and some js files,  the real meat of it , is in index.html,
