the image will shink because the column it is inside is shrininking 
and the text is rearranging and re-laying itself on the screen, because it doesn't have as much horizontal width as it did before 

and let me stretch the broser  back  out, and jsut so you can see if i inspct elemtn on span 1, you can see the width here is 6 percent and change 
this is the classic design trade-off, do u want the content to be reaed, as the brwose resizes, and keep thing on the scerren, 
in the case, you want to stick with a fixed grid, 

resonsive design is a movement that is pick up steam over the past years, sinc more and more phone ont he  the internet re using  tablets, phone, to browse the web 

and the peope are using all sorts of screen sizes, we want to create an optum viewing  exp the for each of them 
optim meaning we to keep the content eashy to read, 
we want to keep the site usrable by having na links availbe, we don;t want to forece a mobile user 
to soom in , zoom out , scroll and pan to get around 
and the same tiem, the user with large sceen we  want the web site to look good for them to  

and the babluser vistes the site, we want it to look good in   landscape-mode
and when they rotate the tablet  90 degree   to look at it in protrait mode, we want it to look good too 
on css f tha enables this responsive design is the  media query feature, the query looks like code you see on the scerrn, 
that sth oyu find in responsive bt style sheet, 
the will aply style to a docu,net only  when the scren has a width between 768  and 979 px
that 's the range of many tablets in portrait mode, 
inside that media query , insdie of the curly braces, u can writhe as many styles as you want ,these tylses hide things, show things, make things
smaller than usual, or larger than usual, 
you can over snything from the default fontsize to container size, to wolumn width, and there are many more queries you can use other than just min ans max width
but those are 2 queries almost always  use in the responsive design,  
bt take care of those  media query        for you ,    in fact they have already defined 5 diferen categroies of  screnn width, 
every thing from the phone-sized screen that is 480 px below,  
to a large display that wil be anyghing that have more than 1200 px horitally 

width dferen size o

fo in we swa the contian had the size of  940 px, if we use bt resonsive  style sheet , bt would change from 940 to 1170px if the web page is showing on a larger display

the col width in this table is showing the width of  span1 coulun of course you double that for  span 2 column and so on  

the gutter width is the space between columns


i notice the colunm widths on screens with less the 767 px become fluid , that they are  percentagebased, 
 ans as we  saw  they can shripkk and grow ,
  but i should also point out all the coluns on this scren size  lose thier flow and stack up on each other , they are gotin to  lay out vertically on the page

  back in our sample i just want to refresh your  memory how this currently  behave in diddferenct befoere we add in any respnvisev elements
  we have on the top , we have fluid grid on the bottom, and if i shink the browse down to about the width of a smart phone's screen
  ou can see that the fix grid stays in the fixed 940 px contianer, a lot of content is now off to the right that forces the user to scroll, pan or zoom

  and the flu has it's own sets of proble, yes it keeps any tihg in the screen, beut it can't make colunn, like those span1 columns
   they are so smaller liek ths psan they are not usable any more, 

   ubin that case, there 's a class called tabbable you can use, jsut very similar to nave tabs
   but also a little diffrent, 
   so if i format this code and alos fix it up so we dont ahve rows inside of our spans

    then what wie wil see is we have a div with a class of tabbable, we have an unorder list  
	that will be our nav tab, it's goint to be 2 tabs inside of here, tab1, 2, 
	those are both using anhor tag inside list items as   you would expect,
