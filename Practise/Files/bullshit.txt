the image will shink because the column it is inside is shrininking 
and the text is rearranging and re-laying itself on the screen, because it doesn't have as much horizontal width as it did before 

and let me stretch the broser  back  out, and jsut so you can see if i inspct elemtn on span 1, you can see the width here is 6 percent and change 
this is the classic design trade-off, do u want the content to be reaed, as the brwose resizes, and keep thing on the scerren, 
in the case, you want to stick with a fixed grid, 

resonsive design is a movement that is pick up steam over the past years, sinc more and more phone ont he  the internet re using  tablets, phone, to browse the web 

and the peope are using all sorts of screen sizes, we want to create an optum viewing  exp the for each of them 
optim meaning we to keep the content eashy to read, 
we want to keep the site usrable by having na links availbe, we don;t want to forece a mobile user 
to soom in , zoom out , scroll and pan to get around 
and the same tiem, the user with large sceen we  want the web site to look good for them to  

and the babluser vistes the site, we want it to look good in   landscape-mode
and when they rotate the tablet  90 degree   to look at it in protrait mode, we want it to look good too 
on css f tha enables this responsive design is the  media query feature, the query looks like code you see on the scerrn, 
that sth oyu find in responsive bt style sheet, 
the will aply style to a docu,net only  when the scren has a width between 768  and 979 px
that 's the range of many tablets in portrait mode, 
inside that media query , insdie of the curly braces, u can writhe as many styles as you want ,these tylses hide things, show things, make things
smaller than usual, or larger than usual, 
you can over snything from the default fontsize to container size, to wolumn width, and there are many more queries you can use other than just min ans max width
