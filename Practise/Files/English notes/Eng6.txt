A decimal is a fraction that is written in the form of a dot followed by one or more numbers which represent tenths, hundredths, and so on: for example, .5, .51, .517. 小数
tenth, hundredth: 小数点后第一, 二位  
JavaScript provides the standard numerical operators ... multiplication,division, and modulus(取模),    22 %(读mod)  3   
The other alternative to avoid this problem of inexact decimal fractions is to work with whole numbers. This is commonly used when working with money. 
Instead of working with parts of dollars, instead we convert everything into cents.
When you write a regular expression, most characters match themselves(***). There's also a thing called character classes(**character class), which is where a special character or
set of characters is used to match certain groups such as backslash lowercase W will match any word character,
Square brackets is used to denote a set of characters.(like [a-z])
The dot character matches any character, and curly braces are quantifiers.  quantifier:语法学】数量词(如 eight, ten, much, many, few)

The Shanghai Metro system is the world's largest rapid transit system by route length totaling 644 kilometres. It is the second largest by number of stations with 393 stations on 16 lines.
It ranks second in the world by annual ridership with 3.53 billion rides delivered in 2017. The daily ridership record was set at 12.355 million on March 23, 2018.[2] Over 10 million people use the system
on an average workday(???).
The operating hours(**) for most Shanghai metro stations starts between 5:00 to 6:00 in the morning and ends between 22:30 to 23:00
The busiest station in Shanghai Metro system is People's Square station (Lines 1, 2 and 8). As the interchange station for three lines, it is extremely crowded during peak hours(**). 
It remains busy during the rest of the day as it is located near major shopping and tourist destinations such as East Nanjing Road, a pedestrian street, as well as the Shanghai Museum, People's Park,
the Shanghai Grand Theatre and Yan'an Park on People's Square. It has the second largest number of exits (totalling 17) in the stations of the metro system.

*****A turnstile['tɝnstaɪl], also called a baffle gate or turnstyle, is a form of gate which allows one person to pass at a time. It can also be made so as to enforce one-way(**) traffic of people, 
and in addition, it can restrict passage only to people who insert a coin, a ticket, a pass, or similar. Thus a turnstile can be used in the case of paid access
(sometimes called a faregate or ticket barrier when used for this purpose), for example to access public transport, a pay toilet, or to restrict access to authorized people, 
for example in the lobby of an office building.

attempted to standardise the size of the football pitch for international matches and set the official dimensions of a pitch to 105 m long by 68 m wide.[5]
Although the term goal line is often taken to mean only that part of the line between the goalposts, in fact it refers to the complete line at either end of the pitch, from one corner flag to the other
Goals are placed at the centre of each goal-line.These consist of two upright posts placed equidistant from the corner flagposts, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar.
The inner edges of the posts must be 7.32 metres (8 yd) apart, and the lower edge of the crossbar must be 2.44 metres (8 ft) above the ground
Rules regarding the shape of goalposts and crossbars are somewhat more lenient(**)
but they must conform to a shape that does not pose(***) a threat to players.

(** a very logn sentence)A goal may, however, be ruled illegal (and void by the referee) if the player who scored or a member of his team commits an offence under any of the laws between the time the ball was previously out of play and the goal being scored.
