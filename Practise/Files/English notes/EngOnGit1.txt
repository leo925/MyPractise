Most user agents, aka web browsers will not make requests in a serial one by one fashion, instead they can open multiple, parallel, connections to a server.
Hopefully that will cut the amount of time needed to display the images in half, but it's not always perfect like that.(cut in half).
So, for example, in IE eight you can now have up to six concurrent connections per host.(up to:达到(某数量、规格等) 多达；直到 );
a URL cannot restrict the client or the server to a specific type of technology. (restrict to)
