Most user agents, aka web browsers will not make requests in a serial one by one fashion, instead they can open multiple, parallel, connections to a server.
Hopefully that will cut the amount of time needed to display the images in half, but it's not always perfect like that.(cut in half).
So, for example, in IE eight you can now have up to six concurrent connections per host.(up to:达到(某数量、规格等) 多达；直到 );
a URL cannot restrict the client or the server to a specific type of technology. (restrict to)

If you have too many connections open it can saturate (浸透，使湿透；使饱和，使充满) and congest the network,
If people or things saturate a place or object, they fill it completely so that no more can be added. 使饱和; 使充满
If someone or something is saturated, they become extremely wet. 使湿透
In the early days of the web
That(persistent connection) leaves the browser with an already open socket it can use to continue making requests to the server, without the overhead(*) of opening a new socket.
they typically reduce memory usage, reduce CPU usage, reduce network congestion, reduce latency, they generally improve the response time of a page, but like everything in software there is always a downside.
And likewise, when the application creates the HTTP response message, the server also has a chance to interact with that message on the way out.
For example, a server knows that the client supports gzip compression, because a client can advertise that fact through an accept encoding header in the HTTP request.
client:Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  server:Content-Encoding: gzip  or Content-Encoding: compress  or Content-Encoding: deflate
each request response transaction is independent of any previous or future transaction.
the viewstate is included in the post to the server which can recreate the Web form just like it was when it last left the server by deserializing that value 
HTTPs requires the server to have a cryptographic  [,krɪptə'græfɪk]  certificate
cryptograph: ['krɪptəʊɡrɑːf] 密码，密文
cryptography [krɪp'tɑgrəfi] 密码学；密码使用法
First of all, all traffic over HTTPs is encrypted in the request and the response. That includes the HTTP headers and the message body and basically everything except the host name. That means that the URL 
path and the URL query string is encrypted as well as all cookies. So HTTPs prevents session high jacking because no eavesdroppers can inspect a message and steal a cookie.
Now a browser can use that certificate to validate that it is truly talking to the server that it thinks it's talking to. 
HTTPs traffic is also impossible to cache in a public cache because once a message is encrypted, it's intended for(*) a single user.
transport layer security  = TLS  /  Secure Sockets Layer=SSL
And now this is the last module of the course. I hope you enjoyed the material and that you were able to take away an in-depth（*） knowledge of HTTP and how it works.
there is a complementary(*) attribute called tear down ( setup in UT) 
So in building one web page like that a browser will typically make multiple HTTP requests to retrieve all the resources needed for that one page to display properly in the browser. 
I can even take that link and hand it to someone else and if they follow that link they, too, will be taken to that particular spot so that this particular section of the resource appears on the page instead of starting at the very top of the page 
If you've been following along so far, then you'd be able to look at this URL and know that it has a scheme, which is HTTP, and that's required; a host name called host, that's also required;
a port of 8,080; a URL path called path; a query string, q equals query; and finally a fragment.
A URL should be as easy to communicate through email as it is to put on a billboard or a bumper sticker(*) or a business card. 
A bumper sticker is a small piece of paper or plastic with words or pictures on it, designed for sticking onto the back of your car. It usually has a political, religious, or humorous message. 保险杠贴纸
guidepost , guide map,   road sign , 意思:查bing图片
the space character is considered unsafe because spaces are hard to read. They can mistakenly(*) appear/disappear when a URL is in printed form.
Other unsafe characters include the pound sign because it's used to delimit a fragment. That doesn't mean that you cannot use a pound sign in a URL; 
--it just means that the pound sign can only be used in its reserved(*) position which is to delimit a fragment.
Another unsafe character is the caret because it isn't always transmitted correctly through the network.
case insensitive:不区分大小写   lower/upper case alphabet
20 is the hexadecimal value for the space character in the US ASCII character set.
so a percent encoding is basically taking that hexadecimal value, putting a percent in front and then replacing a character in the URL with that percent encoded value.
On the service side, you should run dynamically created URLs through the encoding algorithm just in case one of the unsafe characters will appear in the URL. 
In order for a host to properly serve a resource and in order for the client to properly display a resource
Demarcate, delimit, we should demarcate our responsibility

html fundamentals:
We could also append a named anchor on to the H ref for another page and navigate into that page to the named anchor. 
So if we follow(** see definition below) a link to this named anchor then we should come to this terminology section. 
If you follow a path, route, or set of signs, you go somewhere using the path, route, or signs to direct you. 沿着…走
So what I'm doing is saying take me to that page and further take me down into the named anchor within that particular page
If I go back and change this(TH) to a TD in here, you'll see it just shows up left justified(*左对齐).

. You can see that's going to show up now and you'll notice the way these things are lining up(对齐 see below). So we have a row in the heading and we have two different table headers,
so we've got two columns and then in the footer we have a row, we just have the one column and so you'll notice down here that adds flowing underneath the first column of the headers
and then this second column is standing out here all in(网上查，on one's one:独立的/地) its own. 
*If you line one thing up with another, or one thing lines up with another, the first thing is moved into its correct position in relation to the second. You can also say that two things line up, or are lined up. 与…对齐; 对齐

We also have a meta view port tag by default and this is important for mobile devices. You can think of this as an instruction for how the page should render. So, without this meta tag,
a mobile browser will assume that your page needs over 900 pixels to display properly. So, it will zoom out to fit all of the content on the screen. But because it's so zoomed out, 
the user cannot work with the site until they zoom in. But with this tag in place, we are telling a mobile browser that our site will adapt to(*) the width of the device. 
So, please don't assume anything about how many pixels we need. 
I want to close the browser and return to Visual Studio to start poking around(随意探索;闲逛) inside of this project.
Three of these folders have a special significance
The ASP.NET MVC framework derives its name from the model view controller design pattern.
A stimulus is something that encourages activity in people or things. 刺激物
A controller is a software component that will be the target for some external stimulus(*). In the case of a web application that external stimulus(*) is usually an incoming HTTP request.
That isolation that you achieve with the MVC pattern makes it easy to maintain and change your application moving forward because the code inside of each of these pieces is very focused and easier to understand.
I do want to point out that the MVC design pattern doesn't dictate what type of data access you use.
There is no large obstructions here that try to shield you from knowing things like what HTTP verb is being used to place a request.
A tripod /ˈtraɪpɒd/  is a stand with three legs that is used to support something such as a camera or a telescope. 三脚架
A stand is an object or piece of furniture that is designed for supporting or holding a particular kind of thing. 托架
The teapot came with(come with/go with 感觉 有配对的意思) a stand to catch the drips.

And that was just intended to(是用来) simulate some sort of data access. 
div, by default is going to be treated as a block level container and it's going to render on its own next kind of logical line or space in the document.

When specifying sizes, CSS offers a wide array of measurements(**量度制). 
you'll first have to pick between absolute or relative units.
A unit of measurement is a fixed standard quantity, length, or weight that is used for measuring things. The quart, the inch, and the ounce are all units. (计量用的) 单位                        
Some of these property values are set using dedicated keywords                            
The background color, by the way, is specified in hexadecimal rgb format                        
For now I'll just tell you that that(padding) particular setting will push the content of a web page further away from the edge of the containing window by 10 pixels
This site provides a table allowing you to cross reference(***) specific CSS features against different versions of IE, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Firefox. 
It's important to understand a little bit about the specifications because they do evolve and one of the unfortunate characteristics of CSS is that you'll find varying support among the different browsers.
my definition list for terminology is down here lower and you can't actually see it when we're on the top of the page

And also it's a little bit ugly to have both the black border on the bottom of a list item and also an underline under the hyperlink.                
If I wanted to get rid of that what I could say is that the anchor tags inside of a list item should have a text-decoration of none as opposed to underline, 
you'll first have to pick between absolute or relative units.          
Relative units, like percentages or the keywords larger or smaller or ems, they allow you set a font size based on some baseline(**)
A baseline is a value or starting point on a scale with which other values can be compared. (价值的)基准

we can see that versionInfo = actually is on a different line than the line that ends here with a semicolon.
But web browsers generally don't respect(**有考虑;关心,的意思) things like tabs and new lines and carriage returns inside of HTML code.

There are certain properties that we could set on that parent div or on the parent body that will flow through and be inherited by all of the children underneath that element.
it doesn't make the whole page bounce up and down because the space is still there to display it when it comes back on. 
not only does it not render, but there's also no space there to render it in. 
Inline elements are elements like span, they don't create more vertical space unless they're forced to. 
Block elements always sit on top of each other by default.
Well I'd have to take the width of the list element content, which is 150 pixels, I'd have to remember that there's a left border of 10 pixels, that puts us at(**) 160.                        
Technically they will overlap until one of the margins touches the border of the other element, meaning you'll always have a margin that is the maximum
-- amount of the bottom and top margins that are meeting.
Understanding how to size and arrange these boxes is a large step towards understanding web design with CSS.
Each paragraph or div we create will appear underneath the previous div or paragraph. That's what we call the flow of a document, elements just flow downward. 
we have quite a bit of padding that is pushing the content inwards away from the border. 
should have a text-decoration of none as opposed to underline
*****the width setting is no longer in effect. We have some elements displaying that are obviously less than 150 pixels and this is because you cannot set the width of an inline element. They are going to expand so that all their content fits inside in the padding and the border, but that's it. If we wanted these elements to be inline, but still have block characteristics like being able to set the width, that's another display setting, which is inline-block. 
they display inline and will stretch across the page until you run out of space and then they'll bounce down to the next line.                              
****traffic restrictions based on the last digit of license plate numbers                                                 
A floating element can shift to the left or to the right of a line and then allow content to flow along beside it.
If a group of factory workers, nurses, or other people work shifts, they work for a set(规定的；固执的) period before being replaced by another group,
--so that there is always a group working. Each of these set periods is called a shift.You can also use shift to refer to a group of workers who work together on a particular shift.                         
Dave had to work a 12-hour shift yesterday.   early/late/night shift  I am on the early shift tomorrow

That would move the div(A) to the left side of the line and will allow another div to float up(**) and appear to the right of that div(A)                        
what if I wanted to move additional content up beside the image  
move as far left as you can / the image moves as far to the right as it can 
give this  margin to the right of 5 pixels. That'll move the text away a little bit. 
And what would happen if I said, clear just on the right side? The paragraph would come back up because it's only looking to clear things that have been floated to the right

Generally you can just put some code in a file and run it, and in the case of JavaScript, the file that you put code in is typically a web page, though not always.
 despite that syntax it's not got a lot in common with Java,
Nearly every computer in the world has a JavaScript interpreter
exercise a little bit of caution
I'd say maybe 1000 balls is pretty much using up all the resources on my machine, 
tt's been awhile since I've done any Java programming(有一段时间没写java了), but I understand that JavaScript comments work the same as Java comments
single line comment is just a line of text beginning with two forward slash characters
It's also possible to do multiline comments. The starting character is forward slash star.Everything from there until star forward slash is considered to be part of the comment.
In a previous module I talked about JavaScript variables and their weakly typed nature. Variables are declared with the var keyword and don't have a type until a value is assigned to the variable, and at that point the type is inferred from the value.
this can introduce some subtle and unintended behaviors
Global variables should be avoided because they introduce coupling between parts of your application that access the shared global variable,
One important thing to note about null is that when it's used in a Boolean expression(***) it evaluates to false
One of the most common reasons to encounter undefined is when a non-existent object property is requested. 
The same thing holds for(** 适用 ) numbers as well.                  
if we call toString on a regular expression and this is the regular expression literal notation(**)
(***)The reason this is bad is it introduces a whole class of bugs including this one here that I've included for an example where I'm testing 
--whether the empty string is equal to the number 0
so we'd expect this output here "undefined evaluates to false," which we can see(***) happens.
(********) we're looping through every item within the arguments object.  /  loop through each item
it behaves like an array in that it's indexable(**) like an array,
The == and != operators do type coercion.
 If I change one of those objects it's not reflected in the other.
 . When an exception is thrown, execution stops at that point and control is passed up the call stack until the exception is handled or until the top of the call stack is reached.
 (E): If the catch block is given an argument, the value of that argument will be set to the exception object that was given to the throw statement. 
 (e): A finally block can also be attached to the try/catch block, and it's used to guarantee execution of a set of statements.
 (e):One of the most common reasons to encounter undefined is when a non-existent object property is requested.
  One quirk(怪事; 趣事) that can throw off(使犯错误；使产生错觉；使迷惑) beginners is that when using the object literal notation that we've previously discussed you 
  --have to remember that properties are assigned using this colon syntax, not using equals.
  He had an error but he was receptive(对新思想或建议) 乐于接受的 to correction.
  chic: [ʃɪk]  chick ornaments    boutique  A boutique is a small shop that sells fashionable/chic clothes, shoes, or jewellery.
  in other words if the browser is 3000 px wide, I want it to stay flush right(右对齐) or flush left and expand the columns so they takes up space, 
 a span12 column would be 100% width while span1 would be around 6%  or so(大约，左右)

fixed:
abolute:  we have divContainer whose position is default(static), and divInside, if divInside 's position is absolute, and top is 50px; it is moved 50 px from top relative to window ;
if divContainer's position is also absolute, divInside is 50 px from top relative to divContainer.
         when with position absolute and bottom 0, it's moving it 0 pixel from the bottom of the window, not from the bottom of its original position
relative: with relative position, the tag is not being taken out of document flow;and the orginal space is maintained
*** if the container div 's position is set to absolute/relative(没有试fix), and the inner div 's position is absolute, the inner div responds to container instead of the window
static:

Unlike applying padding or margin when the paragraph moves, it's not going to try to push anything out of its way, it's literally just going to jump and sit on top of the other thing.

I really want to push this part, this content area, down 115 pixels
make it into a header that spans across both columns across the top. 
even if the user scrolls the window down,                      
Static positioning stacks up elements one after the other down the page. 

The for statement consists of three parts after the for keyword. There's the loop initializer, which is run before the for statement; a condition, which is checked every time that
the for statement is going to start a new iteration, and if the value is true then the block of the for statement is executed again, if it's false then the for statement is finished;
and the incrementer, which is a statement that is run on every iteration.

you can also come ascross(*偶然碰到) a situation you want to display something that is not part of you model(layout),this frequently comes up(发生) with your layout view
It's(layout view) used on pages that display restaurant reviews but it will also be used on pages that display restaurants or allow a user to register and log in.
 And all of those other scenarios, they do not involve restaurant reviews. So I cannot strongly type this layout view to a particular model.
 can I have it initially populate some data for me into that database
 migrations are a feature of EF that allow you to configure database schemas with c sharp code, seed you database with c#
 and migrations can track changes that you're making in your entity classes.
 web browers tend to bring everything else to a halt when they encounter a script tag.
 and it(data migration) can keep the database schema in sync with the changes that you make in your c# code.
 (validation) there's nothing that constrains(**) the rating to any sort of  scale(**).
 there's also nothing restricts them from entering a body with 1000 characters

 Vary by * to cache for every permutation(  ['pɝmjʊ'teʃən] *) of all parameters.
Vary by 'none' to always cache the same content
Vary by 'name' to cache for every value of name parameter 

(**)These configuration settings then are inherited downwards and the configuration in effect for your application is a combination of all the configuration files. 
(**e.g, under views folder, we have web.config)And we can even inside of our own application have web.config files that override settings for a specific directory.

EF------------
that's not related to query, but the startup cost(**) of using entity framework in the application
another drawback to include is that you can't limit or sort the related data, it's all or nothing, using projection to eagerloading can help you get around that.

 a transient lifetime means a new instance of the type is created every time it is asked for
 a scoped lifetime means the instance will live untill the web request is completely handled.
 singleton lifetime means once an instance is created the same instance will be supplied every time untill the app closes.
