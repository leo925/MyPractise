Get a good night’s sleep before your first day at work to make sure you are feeling refreshed (有精神的) and alert.

It depends on the company culture at your new workplace. If your company doesn’t have a dress code (着装要求), use your best judgement to decide what’s most appropriate to wear for work.  
3.  Get to know your coworkers
Be friendly and introduce yourself to your coworkers. Learn their names and what they do.

Don’t act like a know-it-all (自以为无所不知的) on your first day. When you are new to the company, it’s better to listen than talk(*).
