Advanced - Investing in Emerging Markets A: Dad, I’d like to borrow some money.
(E0029)
b:    Sure, Johnny, how much do you need? bucks?
?ve
a:    Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I wanna get into the market. You know, I’m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuf?ng their money in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity. This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.
b:    I don’t know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don’t know if you’re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There’s just too much instability. I wouldn’t feel comfortable investing in this climate.

a:    But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I’m not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example; they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.
b:    Come on, son, you’re looking at this too naively, the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.
a:    Fine, then! If that’s the way you feel, so be it. But you’re losing out on a great opportunity here. I’m going to go hit up Mum for the cash.

Advanced - Just In Time Strategy a:    (E0047)
I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan. As I’m sure you’re all aware, with the credit crunch, and the global ?nancial crisis, we’re obligated to look for more cost ef?cient ways of producing our goods. We don’t want to have to be looking at redundancies. So, we’ve outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy.
b:    We have two basic points that we want to focus on. First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.
C:
Why would want to do that? I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.
b:    Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead timesfor better overall ef?ciency.
Visit the Online Review and Discussion (text version).
c 2008 Praxis Language Ltd.
169
a:    Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes. Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.
C:
I see… That makes sense.
b:    The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program. We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore, they must be eliminated. A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers the personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.
C:
I’m with you on this one. It’s essential that we reduce these errors; we’ve got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

The Weekend - International Workers Day a:    (C0078)
Alright everyone settle down. Let’s get started. As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system. It is not enough to simply memorize our laws, it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed. This brings me to our topic for today. Does anyone know what we celebrate on May ?rst?
b:    Cinco de mayo?
a:    No, that’s May ?fth in Spanish, James, no wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No, May ?rst is International Workers’ Day.
b:    Do we get a day off from school then?
a:    No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.

b:    Aww, man!
a:    In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.
b:    Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?
a:    Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price. On May third, 1886, police ?red into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.
