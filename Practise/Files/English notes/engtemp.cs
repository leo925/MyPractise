 It is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world.
 Trump said that with the increased tariffs he hopes to cut the trade deficit with China by $100 billion.
The actions raised the possibility of a trade war between the two biggest economies and sent global stock markets lower.
Boeing has said it expects China to buy aircraft worth(**) $1.1 trillion by 2036
The U.S. recently placed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports. Some countries, 
-including Canada and Mexico, are not subject to the new taxes.

The United Nations reported last year that, since 2012, China has led the world in the number of tourists who travel
to other countries.The U.N. said Chinese tourists spent $261 billion in foreign countries in 2016. That is more than 
twice the amount that travelers from the U.S. spent.
That group recommends children younger than 18 months should avoid screens other(**chule) than video conferences over the internet.

-or playing inactive screen-based games" are increasingly common
